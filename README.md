# Click_the_dots

The objective of this game is to click the dots as fast as possible. Every time the user beats their time the dots become smaller.

In this new patch I've made so that the user doesn't have to be swithing between mouse and keyboard as much. In addition, I've added
a userboard that can be accessed in game as well as updated so that the player can view their previous scores from best to worst.
